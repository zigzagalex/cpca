# cpca
A C implementation of PCA packaged for python.

This is a personal project to learn 4 things: 
1. Matrix operations and the CBLAS library in C
2. Linear dimensionality reduction using PCA through different SVD algorithms.
3. How to package C code for python use.
4. How to visualize matrix algorithms in python.
